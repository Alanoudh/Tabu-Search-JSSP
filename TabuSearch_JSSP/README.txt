README
	
	This project solved Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Using Tabu Search. Which is the project of the Selected topics in computer science subject.
	This project was implemented using JAVA.

COMPILING AND RUNNING

	In order to run this project simply copy TabuSearch.java to your programming enviroment. Run the main function which will calls all other neede functions.
    The test inctances was provided at the top of the class TabuSearch.java as comments.Theses instances is a 2D array were rows represent the numbure of jobs and the coulmns represent all operations since for each operation we need to store the machine number and the operation duration the number of columns will be equals the number of machines multiply by 2.  
    For example: 
	# Instance 1
	/*
 * 3 5 2 3 4 7 1 3 2 10 3 2 4 2 1 4 1 7 2 4 3 6 4 2 3 8 4 1 2 11 1 7
 * 3 5 2 3 4 7 2 10 3 2 4 2
 */

INPUT
    To customize the class you can edited the values send to the prameters, each parameters was named clearly to indicates the prameter role.
